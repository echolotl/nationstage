# NationStage

NationStage is a Tauri-based desktop client for [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net/), with the goal of having a different UI and integration with the NationStates API.

This project uses a combination of Svelte, TypeScript, and Rust, among others.

This is a beginner project to learn my way around Svelte and Rust.
